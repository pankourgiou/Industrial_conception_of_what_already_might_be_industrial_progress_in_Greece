print("Industry seems not progressing in Greece many years now, yet certain steps are taking place, industry we have and love industry or music and tv industry we have too...development wont's happen unless citizens do the next step. Example music industry does a step then, love and picture/tv industry take place...It's not too early this to happen, and we must actually act fast to cover up. Cultural progress though must happen too...didn't you just got bored of this same language idea? Languages progress through time and it's time to move to the next step. We use tools and imagination to do it and we can do it. So progress we must do through the progress of our conception of all those different aspects of life and industry. We say...I don't like Greek TV but we don't say TV persona(name your favourite persona)is valuable is exceptional...we should seek for the right coach and I think Greek TV can become more valuable even outside Greek borders!")
